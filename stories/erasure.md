# Erasure

My eyes feel heavy. For in this moment, I feel tired, depressed and lost. A friend says something encouraging, and I smile, but only the muscles on my face move, not the warmth in my heart.

It is so easy to get lost in this feeling, stuck in a room. Has the outside been erased? I see it through my window, and I can reach for it, but the energy to go there is lost. A woman runs by with her dog, ears flopping with every step. An old man pushes a cart to the grocery store. They are outside and I am here.

I am unaware of what changed to start this feeling. Is it the news? I was exhausted after the house warming last week. Maybe that was it? Money has been tight, and I've been scared for what that means? I don't know. It all seems so much.

Alexa closed all of the blinds and locked the door yesterday. I am not sure why, but they won't open back up. Normally the blinds open and close with the sunrise and sunset. They never opened yesterday. I see the door is locked. Maybe I did that? I can't remember. The darkness is nice.

Days have passed. I sleep. Bed has become a nest for me. The display on the nightstand says it is three in the afternoon, but I could not tell you based on the light in this room. I have made trips to the bathroom. I have eaten some ramen and some cereal. At one point I tried cooking, and it was the most disgusting thing I have ever made. The dishes are a pile in the sink. The trash smells when I am in there. I'll deal with it tomorrow. For now I'll just lay in bed. My phone occasionally provides emotional warmth as I see photos of friends out in the world, traveling, eating, having fun. Cute pictures of animals bring me joy. The American Pika is the cutest animal I have ever seen. I like the photo. Later I awake with my phone battery dead and the sound of some children yelling outside.

My boss has been texting me more and more, wondering why I haven't shown up to meetings

Initial Prompt: I am writing a collection of short stories. This is a new story about feeling trapped in one's own home. The theme of the book is location, technology and nature. The theme of the story is how depression can isolate you from the world, but technology can keep you connected. Please fill out the below bullets which describe the structure of this story. Use the opening sentences at the top of this page for inspiration.

1. **Introduction/Exposition:** A person struggles with depression that makes them feel disconnected from the outside world, even though they can see it through their window. They find themselves increasingly isolated in their home.
2. **Inciting Incident:** Their smart home system malfunctions, closing all the blinds and dimming the lights, seemingly trapping them further in darkness.
3. **Rising Action:** As they try to fix the system, they begin receiving concerned messages from friends and family who notice their absence from social media and online spaces. The protagonist realizes they haven't interacted with anyone digitally in days.
4. **Climax:** In a moment of clarity while video chatting with a friend, they realize the "malfunctioning" smart home system was actually responding to their own gradual withdrawal - they had been slowly closing themselves off from the world.
5. **Falling Action:** With help from their online support network, they begin to make small changes - opening one blind at a time, turning up the lights gradually, and maintaining digital connections even when physical interaction feels overwhelming.
6. **Resolution/Denouement:** While still dealing with depression, they find a balance between their need for physical solitude and maintaining meaningful connections through technology, understanding that isolation doesn't have to mean complete disconnection.
