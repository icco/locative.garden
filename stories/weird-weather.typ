= Weird Weather

The drone is deafening.

A single sin wave, never changing, is ringing in my ears. Is this real? Is this normal? I do not know. I haven't seen anyone else in a few days.

Was that a change in the sound? 

No lights are flashing, but I see the printer roar to life. 

If the drone was lower, I might hear its traditional back and forth thwack sound as it slammed left to right, back and forth, vomiting ink as it flew by. But no, I hear nothing besides the constant sound.

I grab the paper as it slides onto its precarious plastic diving board. A weather update from my meteorologist team to the North, in the remains of Montreal. A dust storm has appeared and seems to be heading South. 





1. *Introduction/Exposition:* A ruined world, where storms appear out of nowhere that destroy everything in their path. Only weather people can predict them and have become international heroes.
2. *Inciting Incident:* A remote weather station goes offline with no notice. a band of heroes gathers together to go investigate and rescue them.
3. *Rising Action:* The storms in the area are unpredictable, a few members of the party die.
4. *Climax:* The remaining two members of the story reach the remote outpost. The outpost is remaining on the last few people due to power outage and lack of food.
5. *Falling Action:* The team works to repair the generator, and starts predicting storms again. Radios for more food and help.
6. *Resolution/Denouement:* The two surviving members stay on for a year to stabilize the base, and return home forever changed.
