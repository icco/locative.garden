# 2025-03-02 - An unproductive February

Hey folks,

Continuing on my promise to provide monthly updates, this month is a low one. With the shortened month, plus two week long trips (a work trip to San Antonio and a personal trip to London), I wrote very few words this month. Net word count change was 575.

Lately, when I've had a creative urge, I have been leaning on music creation instead of writing. Even then, I only recorded music practice three days in February. My internal debate is if this is ok. I get busy: work, life etc. Finding the balance between making progress on my side projects and relaxation after stressful days is one I haven't figured out. When I wrote my first book, the solution was to write before I did anything else with the day. I should start that back up, as I find it is hard to make excuses when you're first starting your day.

Thanks for listening to me ramble. These monthly updates are a good forcing function for me to think through how I'm approaching the work. So I am now going to eat breakfast and go write at a coffee shop.

Lots of love from Hudson Valley,
