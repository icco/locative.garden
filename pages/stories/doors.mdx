# Doors

North was always a curious boy. Left alone often by his family, as they were busy and important people, he could often be found wandering the large farm his family owned but did not maintain. He loved finding where the squirrels had hidden nuts, seeing where the birds had built their nests, and tracking foot prints dried in the mud of workers and others.

He was, without a doubt, a blessed child, with freedom and safety that only comes from an incomprehensible level of modern wealth. When he wasn't at the farm, he was left alone less frequently, but his curiosity never decreased. His nanny on a trip to Paris found him following around housekeeping after a frantic one hour search of the Four Seasons. He felt no shame at exploring, and even with the amount of chastising he received from his minder and his parents, his shame did not increase, nor his curious mind.
