# Places this book was written

## Both the bench and chair on my dinning room table.


## my small upstairs office desk.

## Kitchen & coffee

## the beacon daily

## Big Mouth coffee

Quiet piano jazz places over the speakers as a line of women discuss the comparitive virtues of coffee shops. In front, a trio of hikers coffee orders have been mixed up while they debate which train to catch back into the city. I sit by the front window, lost in my computer screen, as the occasional car drives down the wintery Main St.

## terminal A delta lounge ATL


## the patio of room 152 and the carambola resort on st. croix


## the metro north hudson line train

Drunk on wine and sick from running to catch the midnight train, i stare into the distance unable to think in complete sentences. Melissa constantly tosses and turns next to me, completely confident and safe, face smushed against the window. An elderly man talks loudly to our left, while every other row sleeps soundly. No express train at this hour, and at each stop one or two rows awake and filter off the train.

the mask tight against my mouth makes me hot, and electronic music bumps in my skull as i dream of bed at stare at the darkness of the Hudson.
