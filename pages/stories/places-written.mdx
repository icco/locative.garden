Drunk on wine and sick from running to catch the midnight train, i stare into the distance unable to think in complete sentences. Melissa constantly tosses and turns next to me, completely confident and safe, face smushed against the window. An elderly man talks loudly to our left, while every other row sleeps soundly. No express train at this hour, and at each stop one or two rows awake and filter off the train.

the mask tight against my mouth makes me hot, and electronic music bumps in my skull as i dream of bed at stare at the darkness of the Hudson.
