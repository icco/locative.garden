# Erasure

My eyes feel heavy. For in this moment, I feel tired, depressed and lost. A friend says something encouraging, and I smile, but only the muscles on my face move, not the warmth in my heart.

It is so easy to get lost in this feeling, stuck in a room. Has the outside been erased? I see it through my window, and I can reach for it, but the energy to go there is lost.
