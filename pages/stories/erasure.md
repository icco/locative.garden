# Erasure

My eyes feel heavy. For in this moment, I feel tired, depressed and lost. A friend says something encouraging, and I smile, but only the muscles on my face move, not the warmth in my heart.

It is so easy to get lost in this feeling, stuck in a room. Has the outside been erased? I see it through my window, and I can reach for it, but the energy to go there is lost.

Initial Prompt: I am writing a collection of short stories. This is a new story about feeling trapped in one's own home. The theme of the book is location, technology and nature. The theme of the story is how depression can isolate you from the world, but techology can keep you connected. Please fill out the below bullets which describe the structure of this story. Use the opening sentences at the top of this page for inspiration.

1. **Introduction/Exposition:** A person struggles with depression that makes them feel disconnected from the outside world, even though they can see it through their window. They find themselves increasingly isolated in their home.
2. **Inciting Incident:** Their smart home system malfunctions, closing all the blinds and dimming the lights, seemingly trapping them further in darkness.
3. **Rising Action:** As they try to fix the system, they begin receiving concerned messages from friends and family who notice their absence from social media and online spaces. The protagonist realizes they haven't interacted with anyone digitally in days.
4. **Climax:** In a moment of clarity while video chatting with a friend, they realize the "malfunctioning" smart home system was actually responding to their own gradual withdrawal - they had been slowly closing themselves off from the world.
5. **Falling Action:** With help from their online support network, they begin to make small changes - opening one blind at a time, turning up the lights gradually, and maintaining digital connections even when physical interaction feels overwhelming.
6. **Resolution/Denouement:** While still dealing with depression, they find a balance between their need for physical solitude and maintaining meaningful connections through technology, understanding that isolation doesn't have to mean complete disconnection.
