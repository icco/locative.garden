# The Landing at Hewey Vale

If you are traveling east on the road to the great city of Tarn, and you are coming from the other great city of this world, Angelino, you will find yourself on top of small mountain. Below you is a valley with a huge river. First time travelers may be concerned, because it looks far too wide to easily cross with a wagon or horses, but the experienced merchant or traveler will know, this is Hewey Vale, and Frederick runs a ferry to cross this immense river.

Frederick is an odd soul. His uncle was one of the founding members of the town, and his mother worked in the Grey Hawk Inn until her death five years ago. His father had died fighting for some king somewhere, a shiftless mercenary who only came home to Tarn once every few years to beat his mother and drink too much. When news of his death finally arrived in their small hovel in Tarn, Frederick's mother Arisa said she had had enough. No tears spilled from her eyes, just a fire. She wrote to her brother inlaw, and two days later everything they owned was strapped to two horses, and they headed west. "Fuck this city, may every penny pinching grab ass whore fucking man die in a gutter!" she yelled as they passed through the gates.

The road was long, and since neither of them had ridden a horse before, the road was longer and more painful than either Frederick or Arisa had imagined. Frederick was five at the time. They stopped often, stretched, struggled with their mounts, and Arisa tried to comfort Frederick as he wailed of pain in his legs.

Two weeks later, they arrived at the town of Hewey Vale. Town might be generous. It had a nice inn, a few shops, and a sawmill. Arisa's brother in law, Christopher, owned the Inn, and had built it twenty years earlier with his partner Michael. It had five rooms upstairs, and a large bar and common room downstairs. Christopher kindly gave them a room, and in exchange, Arisa ran the bar. Michael and Christopher were amazing cooks, and Fredrick learned to love food.

The town sat at the edge of the Hare River. The road to Angelino goes straight through the town and ends at the dock. The Hare River is fierce, and sometimes boats come down river, but mostly folks just needed to cross it. When Frederick was young, the ferry master was Rosalina. She was a tough old woman, whom Michael always said used to be a pirate. As he grew, Frederick would often deliver her lunch or dinner from the Inn, or wake her up from the hammock she slept in next to the dock when someone at the inn needed a crossing. Rosalina became good friends of Frederick and Arisa, and as Frederick grew older he spent more and more time helping her with her ferry.

By fifteen, Frederick was a strong young lad. He would lift and move heavy freight at the inn, the sawmill and at the ferry. He was good at calming horses on the barge as they crossed, and was beloved by all in the town.

One stormy evening, Frederick was bringing up a new keg of ale from the cellar when Christopher yelled down. "Fred! Go find Ros, merchant here needs to cross in a hurry!"

Fred yelled an afirmative up the stairs, and delivered the keg. As soon as he put the keg down for Michael to tap, he jogged out the door. As the door opened, he was shocked to see a storm had appeared while he was downstairs.
