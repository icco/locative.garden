# Introduction

Why? Why did I decide to start a Kickstarter? I have no idea. I was sitting on a porch overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on the island of Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was Christmas Day, 2021. Sitting alone, while my family was at the beach, I was thinking through all sorts of things, wandering across the internet. 

My last two books were written about non-fiction topics that I knew a lot about. But I don't actually enjoy non-fiction, reading or writing it. So I figured I needed a boost, a kick in the pants, to get me back to writing fiction. Fiction which I hadn't written in any consistent manner since high school. I graduated high school in 2006.

Looking at my past work, deadlines and external motivation are great at getting me to do things. So by having people put money, and me committing to a deadline publicly, really excited me.

So I created the kickstarter, and in less than three days, I had enough folks commit that I hit my arbitrary goal of $500. Now I had to write it.
