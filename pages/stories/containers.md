# Containers

I have a love of containers. Shipping containers. Coffee mugs. Boxes. Backpacks. Pots. Glasses. They all hold something, and each one is unique. Well designed with a purpose, but as they hold more and are used they warp and change. A the fabric on a backpack stains and tears. A mug acquires rings from coffee and tea let standing too long. A shipping container full of dents, graffiti and rust from its long journeys. A fresh box of cardboard made from the pulp of recycled boxes that traveled the world itself.

Humans are just like this, a container for a soul. This in itself is a controversial statement, so if you'd like feel free to replace soul with blood or something. But we get beat up, scared, stained and changed as we bounce around.

It was a bright and cold day. I walked the winding streets of my suburban neighborhood, deeply entrenched in a thick coat that reached to my knees, with wool socks, cap and gloves. In my pocket sat an empty stainless steel mug, my cheeks burned from how cold it was. I walked quickly towards the Starbucks at the entrance to my cookie cutter development, hoping for some caffeine, and maybe a quiet place to write for a bit.
