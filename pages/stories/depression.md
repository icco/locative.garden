# Depression

Depression is a wild experience. Some days, you're doing great. Life is just normal. Some people anger you, some excite you, and some make you happy. But every once in a while, depression is like taking an elevator to a deep dark basement. You'll get out at some point, but for a long time you'll be wandering in the dark. Nothing can make the day good. You might cry, get overwhelmed, be less than normal, it's a constant thing, even if the emotions aren't.

I've suffered from depression for a long time, and some days are worse than others. I've tried a lot of treatments, and many have helped. I don't have deep dark moods with the frequency or regularity or length that I used to, but they still happen.

But I am realizing, that meds and tele-therapy can only help so much when everyone else is dead on your space station.

Three years ago, our trade outpost received a visitor from a new species. It was great! Everyone was excited. They traded with us new technology that increased our ability to communicate in real time beyond the limitations of speed of light. We gave them some cool translator technology. Fun was had.

Alas, unbeknownst to them, they carried a disease that was deadly to humans. It quickly killed about 95% of our station's staff. The last five percent had varying levels of immunity, to which we were able to generate a vaccine and cure. Sadly for the other 20, their decline was so pronounced, they were too far gone for the vaccine to have any effect. 

For the last three years, I have been keeping the station running alone. I'm perfectly healthy, and in the last year communications have greatly improved thanks to aforementioned trade, but today is not a good day.
