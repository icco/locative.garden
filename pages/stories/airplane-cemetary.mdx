# Airplane Cemetery

Throughout the western United States there are large dust fields full of aircraft. Some are full of planes built for World War II, some are commercial planes currently not being unused, and others are just planes that have been abandoned to time. These fields are called boneyards, and they have acres upon acres of planes.

If you find yourself in Tucson, Arizona on a breezy day, you can take a drive down to the Davisâ€“Monthan Air Force Base. On this base, they have the United States largest boneyard of planes. All of the planes are unused, waiting for their time to shine with the Department of Defense. Most planes are kept in good condition, but some are in a state of disrepair. Either ready to be turned into parts, or broken beyond repair.

With a call ahead, you can get a tour, and you will find yourself walking past old Air Force Ones, fighter jets, bombers and big transport planes. Rows upon rows of dark grey planes, each identical and baking in the sun. This is where Susan found herself on one spring day. She loved looking at storage facilities, warehouses, factories and more, and had been looking forward to this tour for a while.

Near the end of her tour, a young private pointed out a lone plane in the corner of the base. It was a small propeller plane, and it looked very rundown. Bright white with faded red stripes on the tail. One hole on the side, which looked like a door used to be there. The cockpit windows had been smashed in, but five passenger windows and a rear door seemed to be intact. Despite all of the windows and wear, Susan could not see inside.

Susan asked to get closer, but the Private refused. It was haunted he explained, and no one has gone within five hundred feet of it for over twenty years, in respect for the dead. Susan raised her phone to take a photo, but the Private grabbed her arm, reminding her of the agreement she signed stating no photography while on the base. Apologies were made, and the walked back across the fields, with Susan constantly glancing back until the rows of airplanes blocked the old derelict from sight.
