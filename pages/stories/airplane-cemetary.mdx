# Airplane Cemetery

Throughout the western United States there are large dust fields full of aircraft. Some are full of planes built for World War II, some are commercial planes currently not being unused, and others are just planes that have been abandoned to time. These fields are called boneyards, and they have acres upon acres of planes.

If you find yourself in Tucson, Arizona on a breezy day, you can take a drive down to the Davisâ€“Monthan Air Force Base. On this base, they have the United States largest boneyard of planes. All of the planes are unused, waiting for their time to shine with the Department of Defense. Most planes are kept in good condition, but some are in a state of disrepair. Either ready to be turned into parts, or broken beyond repair.

With a call ahead, you can get a tour, and you will find yourself walking past old Air Force Ones, fighter jets, bombers and big transport planes. Rows upon rows of dark grey planes, each identical and baking in the sun. Viewed from the sky, they look like someone had painted a houndstooth pattern across a swath of the desert. Up close, it just feels like wasteful government spending.

This is where Susan found herself on one spring day. At thirty-two, she felt she was finally learning about herself. Enough money from her Public Relations job that she felt comfortable traveling for herself, and she had been waiting for a long time for permission for this tour. When Susan explained the trip to her coworkers, they just didn't understand. Arizona was a place folks usually were trying to leave, and here she was going to look at airplanes? Why? Susan loved looking at storage facilities, warehouses, factories and more, and this was a fascinating use of American tax payers money. The Department of Defense was one of the largest consumers of things, and unless she joined the military, which she had no interest in, this was a rare chance to look inside the machine.

Despite their skepticism and confusion, Susan was undeterred. Her guide showed her plane type by plane type. Big carriers, small jets, a field of helicopters, each with red and yellow tags hanging from various areas. Some with canvas wrapped around their engines, others with machines and a few people inspecting them.

Near the end of her tour, the young Private in his aviators and single color uniform, pointed out a lone plane in the corner of the base. It was a small propeller plane, and it looked very rundown. Bleached bright white with faded red stripes on the tail. One hole on the side, which looked like a door used to be there. The cockpit windows had been smashed in, but five passenger windows and a rear door seemed to be intact. Despite all of the windows and wear, Susan could not see inside.

Susan asked to get closer, but the Private refused. The Private, whose name was Roger, explained that is was a 1978 C-27A Spartan. It used to belong to the Coast Guard, but crashed off the coast of Cuba in the 90s. It was haunted he explained, and no one has gone within five hundred feet of it for over twenty years, in respect for the dead. Susan raised her phone to take a photo, but the Private grabbed her arm, reminding her of the agreement she signed stating no photography while on the base. Apologies were made, and the walked back across the fields, with Susan constantly glancing back until the rows of airplanes blocked the old derelict from sight.
