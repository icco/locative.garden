# Stones

On the western shore of a lake there rests a red pagoda. This pagoda has a singular stone beneath it. This stone is roughly two feet in diameter, with a sign to the right of it. The sign, in bold letters, instructs you to stay on the path.

I found this pagoda one misty morning while investigating the lake for a new fishing spot. I had cast into the lake at various areas that looked like they might be hiding some trout or bass, but nothing bit. I didn't fish for long, because I kept seeing the pagoda from the corner of my eye. It was so striking in its brilliant red color. It seemed to be almost glowing.

Each cast, I noticed myself slowly navigating closer and closer to the structure, until I was so close I could see the sign. The flies I cast into the water were not sitting long enough for the fish to see them, but rather short enough for me to think I was fishing and not just walking over to this brilliant red structure. 

My curiosity was finally pushed to the breaking point and I put down my rod and walked over. The sign was a simple wood plank. Not plywood, but solid oak. Weather-worn, but the words were cut into the wood, and the cuts looked freshly filled in shiny black paint.

> Stay on the path.

My confusion was great. What path? There was only one stone. I looked around, maybe I was missing something. Nothing in the ground, no stones hidden in the moss or trail ducks sitting in the weeds. It didn't look like the lake had risen and taken some of the stones into its depths either.

Still confused, I drank a sip of coffee from my canteen,  and put it away in my pack. I stepped forward and stood on the stone and looked towards the lake.

Something was off. Just a minute ago, there had been mist rising from the lake and a low fog in the air. Now there was no fog, no mist, but everything else was the same... until I looked down. Below me, now floating a few feet ahead, was another stone.

Curious, I stepped on it. Another stone appeared in front of me. I was fasciated, I kept jumping from stone to stone, until after a while, I noticed the lake below had turned purple. I stopped abruptly on the stone and looked around. I was not in the same lake. I had maybe stepped ten or so times, and now the lake was purple, and there was only one stone behind me and one stone in font of me.

As I took in this shocking deep purple lack, I realized how unusual the stones were. They were perfect circles, slightly rounded on-top, and the little of the stone in front of me I could see was a straight pillar of stone, man made, or like a basalt column.

The lake I stood in the middle of now was much different in layout than the one I had left. The shore was much closer, the banks were not filled with reeds but rather black sand. I bent down to touch the water and it was not water at all, but some sort of viscous fluid, also the air was freezing cold, while my body above the stones was the same nice temperature as it was outside when I first got on the path.

This was so eerie. I had a quick thought of retreating, but I did not see any danger. I threw caution into the wind. I hopped to the next stone. 

I kept jumping stone to stone. Sometimes the water or air would change, but usually it was the shore. It seemed to be closing in on me. The lake shrinking in size. The black sand was no longer sand, but was now looking more like pavement. I saw what looked like a pier to my right during one hop, the next it was more of a building on the shore.

And then I could not keep jumping.

I was standing on a raised bump of asphalt in the middle of a puddle in a dark alleyway. On the what looked like the next stone in front of me was an old man blocking my path. He was sitting cross legged with his back to me. He was wearing a heavily patched brown pilots jacket. His hair was a disheveled dark grey, with a large bald spot in the center. I couldn't see his face. I waited for a moment to see if he would notice me behind him.

Nothing.

"Hello? Could you move aside please?"

Nothing.

I can't jump over him. I don't want to jump on him. Maybe I should try to go around... but the sign said not to leave the path... 

I guess it was just a sign. As the saying goes, signs aren't cops...

Looking down, I step over the puddle and into the alleyway. I look back up and the man is gone. There is no sign of the path at all besides the bump in the puddle. 

I am now in a very cold city alley. Rubbish litters the ground. A light wind blows. The walls to my left are brick and to my right solid metal. Both covered many layers of graffiti. In front of me is a chain link fence I think, it's dark. Turning around, I see a street with some lights. I am pretty far down this alley, but I think I can also hear some music? The buildings shoot so high into the sky I can't see the end.

I start walking towards the music.
