# Space Magic

Ring space stations are where the money is good for gravity mages. While Arclight is a perpetually spinning ring with an artificial sun and a constant nine meters per second of gravity, someone always needs a little bit of space magic to fix their problem.

My studio was in Sector J, down a small alley the locals called the valley of the mages. There were sixteen of us that lived in a variety of apartments in the dead end alley. All of the apartments were different, but each door had a large sign with our name and specialty. My sign said: "Hideo Saito, Gravity", and was on the second floor on the left side of the alley at the top of a small set of stairs. Underneath me was a small cafe where many mages stopped in between jobs, and locals swung by to ask advice, or be friendly.

It was a nice little community, and I felt deeply at home and comfortable in it. I had landed on this station once my apprenticeship ended on Bason 6 eight years ago, and I made friends over ale in this cafe the moment I walked in. My fellow mages were kind, and we shared jobs and recommendations and looked out for each other. The majority of my jobs involved simple but expensive work, where I would correct the gravity inside of space ships. But sometimes I would be hired by passing pilgrims looking for mages to help them terraform a new planet, or other times, I took small jobs making things lighter or heavier to make moving them easier. This is all to say, I kept busy.

Gangs bring in a gravity mage who is causing turmoil across the station? Stumble onto some kind of conspiracy?
