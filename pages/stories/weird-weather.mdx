# Weird Weather

The drone is deafening.

A single sin wave, never changing, is ringing in my ears. Is this real? Is this normal? I do not know. I haven't seen anyone else in a few days.

Was that a change in the sound? 

No lights are flashing, but I see the printer roar to life. 

If the drone was lower, I might hear its traditional back and forth thwack sound as it slammed left to right, back and forth, vomiting ink as it flew by. But no, I hear nothing besides the constant sound.

I grab the paper as it slides onto its precarious plastic diving board. A weather update from my meteorologist team to the North, in the remains of Montreal. A dust storm has appeared and seems to be heading South.
