# 2025-01-30 - Uh, whoops?

Hi there,

I'm sorry for not posting regular updates for the last ... three years. My consistency in writing has been all over the place. 

I have not forgotten about this project nor stopped working on it. When I started this project, I don't think I truly understood how differently writing fiction and non-fiction is. The majority of my fiction writing in the past had been in classes, where there was always a deadline. A hard stop point. When I write non-fiction, there's a finite "have I taught the person what I know" point. It may be less measurable than a deadline, but still it is measurable.

With fiction, especially a collection of short stories, I am constantly revising, throwing out, editing, etc. I don't really know when I am done.
